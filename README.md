# Health Prediction Model

This project is focused on predicting health conditions using a **Random Forest Classifier**. It leverages various health-related features to classify users as either in good health or at risk of specific health issues.

## *Project Overview*

*The goal of this project is to provide a predictive model that can help in early diagnosis and monitoring of health conditions based on user-provided data.*

### **Project Structure**

- `app.py`: The main Flask application file for serving the model.
- `model/pipe.pkl`: Pre-trained model pipeline including all necessary pre-processing and classification steps.
- `templates/`: Directory containing HTML templates for the web interface.
- `static/`: Directory containing static files like CSS and JavaScript.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies required to run the project.

### *Key Features*

- **Data Preprocessing**: The model pipeline includes several preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Model Training**: The Random Forest Classifier is trained on a health dataset to classify users based on their health condition.
- **Web Interface**: A user-friendly web interface built using Flask that allows users to input their data and receive health predictions.

### ***Getting Started***

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/health-prediction-model.git
   cd health-prediction-model
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**  
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Access the Application**  
   Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

### **Usage**

1. *Navigate to the web interface.*
2. *Enter your health-related information in the form provided.*
3. *Submit the form to receive a prediction regarding your health condition.*

### **Model Details**

The model uses the ***Random Forest Classifier*** algorithm due to its high accuracy and robustness. The following features are used for prediction:

- **Age**
- **Gender**
- **Blood Pressure**
- **Heart Rate**
- **Symptoms (e.g., fever, cough)**
- And more...
